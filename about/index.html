<p>The Clare Hall Mathematical Association (CHMA) was founded in February 2017 by a finite set of mathematics and computer science students at the graduate-only Cambridge college of Clare Hall. Our mission is to provide a unique opportunity for the discussion of advanced mathematical topics and to create a stimulating environment for research-minded students. Although the CHMA is most accessible to students in mathematical fields, all graduate students are welcome and encouraged to <a href="/join">join</a>.</p>

<p>The CHMA holds weekly lunches in college which are attended by Clare Hall students as well as mathematics faculty members. The conversation topics at these informal lunchtime meetings range from light-hearted chatter about any subject to current mathematical events and research. Additionally, the CHMA organises one or more <a href="/events">social event</a> each academic term, such as a sponsored trip to another university or institution, or a public talk by a speaker from the mathematical sciences.</p>

<p>Our founding event was a trip to the famous annual Bonfire Night in the small town of Lewes in 2016. This awe-inspiring evening of processions, fireworks, and bonfires provided the spark for the creation of the CHMA, and to this day our logo is based on that of the Commercial Square Bonfire Society in Lewes which hosted us at their spectacular evening display.</p>

<h3 id="committee">Committee</h3>

<p>The day-to-day management of the Association is facilitated by the Committee:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arran Fernandez <sub>(president)</sub></li>
  <li>Anne Herrmann <sub>(secretary)</sub></li>
  <li>Mario Cekic <sub>(treasurer)</sub></li>
  <li>Neil Khosla <sub>(public relations officer)</sub></li>
  <li>Hamed Masaood <sub>(events officer)</sub></li>
  
</ul>

<h3 id="constitution">Constitution</h3>

<p>The operation of the CHMA is formally governed by the <a href="/assets/files/CHMA_Constitution.pdf">Constitution</a> and the <a href="/assets/files/CHMA_StandingOrders.pdf">Standing Orders</a>.</p>

<h3 id="getting-involved">Getting Involved</h3>

<p>If you would like to take part in running the Association, please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>. Handling a young society like CHMA can be really fun - a startup-like culture with a high pace of growth creates a great environment for anyone to explore new ideas and make a strong impact on the Associationâ€™s future.</p>

<h3 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h3>

<p>We are grateful to our college <a href="https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/">Clare Hall</a> for the financial and logistic support which enabled us to create and sustain the Association.</p>
